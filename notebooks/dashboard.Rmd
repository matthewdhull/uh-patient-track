```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
ansa_df <- read.csv2("../data/ANSA.csv", sep=",")
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
